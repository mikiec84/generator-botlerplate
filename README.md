Recast.AI's official Generator Botlerplate in Node.js with [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io)

## Synospis

This module is a generator that will help you easily start your project!


For more instructions on the Botlerplate, go to [Github Botlerplate](https://github.com/RecastAI/botlerplate)

```
## Usage

```bash

```

When asked for a project name:

![alt text][logo2]

Enter the name you want for your bot, example: myFirstSlackBot.



Then, choose if you prefer to use the sources of the botlerplate, with all ressources directly available,
or the module, if you'd rather have a started project to work on but use the node module of the Botlerplate. Either way, you'll have something to start working on.

Select your preferences, and the Botlerplate will take care of the rest.



Next step is choosing if you need a mongoDB or not.

If you want a mongoDB, the required package will be installed. You just need to fill the config.js when all steps are completed. You can also install it after, no problems.



When asked for the connector you want to use, choose between Slack, Messenger, Kik, Microsoft Bot connector, or just don't connect your bot.
This connector will automatically connect your bot to the chosen channel. You will directly have the server you need, so it's easier for you.

In this last step, decide if you want to have an example intent or not. The example given is a bot explaining you how to start with Recast.AI.
You can always refer to our documentation for further information.
The intents you'll get as an example are the ones from the bot you automatically have when registering on [Recast.AI](https://recast.ai).

Press enter, and let the generator do the rest! 

Everything you need is created in a folder with your project's name.

```bash
cd myFirstSlackBot/
```

You have a folder with your config.js, all your modules installed, your package.json, and src direcotry with a starter-pack of the channel you chose.

Here it is!


You now have your own chatbot. Improve this code to make an even more amazing and custom bot!


Don't forget to improve your config.js file, and to start using it, use this command:


npm start: builds and runs the server,


npm run server: runs the server for development (with live reload)


npm run build: builds all the sources from es6 to es5


npm run emulator: tests your bot on your terminal
