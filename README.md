Recast.AI's official Generator Botlerplate in Node.js with [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io)

## Synospis

This module is a generator that will help you easily start your project!


For more instructions on the Botlerplate, go to the [Botlerplate](https://github.com/RecastAI/botlerplate)

```bash
npm install -g generator-botlerplate
```
## Usage

```bash
yo botlerplate
```

When asked for a project name:

[logo2]: https://github.com/RecastAI/generator-botlerplate/blob/features/prompt/generators/app/ressources/name.png "Recast.AI"

![alt text][logo2]

Enter the name you want for your bot, example: myFirstSlackBot.



Then, choose if you prefer to use the sources of the botlerplate (with all source files directly available)
or the module (with npm). Either way, you'll have something to start working on.

Select your preferences, and the Botlerplate will take care of the rest.



Next step is choosing if you need a mongoDB or not.

If you want a mongoDB, the required package will be installed. You just need to fill the config.js when all steps are completed. You can also install it after, no problems.



When asked for the connector you want to use, choose between:
* Slack
* Messenger
* Kik
* Microsoft Bot connector
* or just don't connect your bot.

This connector will automatically connect your bot to the chosen channel. You will directly have the server you need, so it's easier for you.

In this last step, decide if you want to have a code example with all the logic or not. The example given is a bot explaining you how to start with Recast.AI.
You can always refer to our documentation for further information.
The intents you'll need to launch this example bot are the ones from the bot you automatically have when registering on [Recast.AI](https://recast.ai).

Press enter, and let the generator do the rest! 

Everything you need is created in a folder with your project's name.


```bash
cd myFirstSlackBot/
```

You have a folder with your config.js, all your modules installed, your package.json, and src direcotry with a starter-pack of the channel you chose.

```bash

node_modules/
package.json
config.js
src
 |- actions
 |     |- booking.js
 |     |- greetings.js
 |     |- information.js
 |     |- no.js
 |     |- yes.js
 |
 |---- core
 |       |- action.js
 |       |- bot.js
 |       |- conversation.js
 |       |- emulator.js
 |
 |- server.js
    
```


Here it is!

You now have your own chatbot. Improve this code to make an even more amazing and custom bot!
